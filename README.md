# React Todo List with Context API

I created a Todo List application using React and the Context API to manage state. This application allows users to add, remove, and toggle tasks efficiently. Utilizing the Context API ensures that state management is streamlined and components can access the necessary state without prop drilling.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Toggle Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete with a simple click.
- **Context API**: Efficient state management without prop drilling.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prabal-verma/Todo-list.git
   cd react-todo-list
   ```

 ## Usage

- **Add a task**: Type your task into the input field and press Enter or click the "Add" button.
- **Remove a task**: Click the delete icon next to the task you want to remove.
- **Toggle a task**: Click on the task to mark it as complete or incomplete.

## Code Overview

### Components

- **TodoApp**: The main component that renders the todo list and input field.
- **TodoList**: Renders the list of tasks.
- **TodoItem**: Represents a single task item.
- **TodoInput**: Handles the input for adding new tasks.

### Context
